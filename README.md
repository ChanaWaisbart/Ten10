# **Weekly purchasing groups**

## General idea
**A weekly sales arena offering 10 branded products in a diverse product mix**.

Every product offered is sold at a significant discount.
Of each product, only 10 units are offered for sale,
with the purchase actually being made as a group purchase and the transaction closing only when 10 products have been ordered.


## UI
Once registered, each user can add to the basket of the ten products on sale this week.

In the shopping cart, the user is presented with the products whose group has not yet been completed and the products that have already been completed.

Add to cart is a commitment to make the purchase if the group of this product is completed and therefore after the product is completed the user can not cancel the purchase

Upon closing the group the user will receive an update email and will need to log in to the site and make the actual payment


## Manager interface
Login to the admin area is with a username :  
> ten10.earn10@gmail.com

and password :
>  tenearn1010

Once logged in, the manager can choose which products will appear next week.


## Week closing
In a new week, new products are updated.
All products whose purchasing group has not been completed
will be deleted from the shopping cart of the users who ordered them.

## Usage
open folder `Ten10` in `cmd`, run-

> *npm start*
